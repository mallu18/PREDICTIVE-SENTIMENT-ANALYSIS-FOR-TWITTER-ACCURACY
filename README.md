# PREDICTIVE-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-FOR-TWITTER-ACCURACY
This is about accuracy of twitter Predictive  Sentiment Analysis using Python Machine Learing.

The Project is given  by Varcons Technologies Pvt Ltd ,
In this project we can take a look accuracy of the twitter using the Python Machine Learning.
By this we have improved the accuracy of twitter upto 94% .

# SOFTWARE SPECIFICATION 
The software in this this project is  Python3.10 and Jupyter  Notebook.

# Dataset Information

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

For training the models, we provide a labelled dataset of 31,962 tweets. The dataset is provided in the form of a csv file with each line storing a tweet id, its label and the tweet.
